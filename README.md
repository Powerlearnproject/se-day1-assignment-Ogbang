Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of programming languages: The 1950s saw the advent of early computers, and software engineering began with the development of machine-level programming languages (e.g., Assembly) and high-level programming languages like Fortran and COBOL.

2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s:As software complexity increased, the term "software crisis" was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968, highlighting the challenges in managing large, complex software projects. This marked the need for systematic approaches to software development, which led to the emergence of software engineering as a discipline.

3. Advent of structured programming in the 1970s: Pioneered by developers like Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming aimed to improve software clarity and reduce errors. The use of control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) instead of the unstructured "goto" command led to more maintainable and reliable software. The development of structured programming languages like C in the early 1970s played a key role in shaping modern programming practices and software design.

4. Emergence of Software Engineering Methodologies: The Waterfall model, introduced in the 1970s but popularized in the 1990s, was one of the first formalized software development methodologies. It advocated a linear, sequential approach to software development, which made it easier to plan and manage projects. As software projects grew in size and complexity, the limitations of Waterfall became apparent. The Agile movement emerged in the late 1990s, emphasizing iterative development, flexibility, and collaboration. Agile frameworks like Scrum and XP provided structured yet flexible ways to manage development cycles, leading to faster delivery of high-quality software and more collaboration between developers and stakeholders.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning: The planning phase is the first step, where the project goals, scope, and requirements are defined. This is the foundation for the entire project.
2. Design: This phase focuses on creating the architecture of the software and defining how the system will function.
3. Development (Implementation): This is the actual coding or programming phase where the software is built based on the design.
4. Testing: The testing phase ensures that the software is free of bugs, meets the requirements, and functions as expected.
5. Deployment: This phase involves releasing the software for use in a live environment.
6. Maintenance: The maintenance phase ensures that the software continues to work as expected over time, with ongoing support and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

•	Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.
•	Agile: An iterative, flexible approach that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptive planning. Work is done in short cycles called sprints.

- Waterfall methodology is sequential and rigid in structure, while Agile methodology is iterative and flexible
- Waterfall methodology is low in flexibility as it is difficult to make changes once a phase is complete, while Agile methodology is high in flexibility as it accommodates changes easily .
- Waterfall methodology is limited to initial planning & final delivery, no customer involvement, while Agile methodology encourages continuous feedback from customer throughout development.
- Waterfall methodoly is high in risk as issues found late in the process can be costly, while Agile methodology lower risk as frequent testing helps identify issues early
- Long – full product is delivered at the end for waterfall methodology, Short – incremental deliveries in each sprint for Agile methodology

Best Scenarios for Waterfall:
1.	Projects with well-defined requirements – E.g., building a bridge or manufacturing a product where changes are costly.
2.	Regulated industries – E.g., healthcare or banking systems that require strict documentation and compliance.
3.	Large-scale projects – E.g., government contracts or aerospace projects where risk needs to be minimized.
4.	Short-term projects with a clear scope – E.g., updating an internal HR system with predefined functionality.

Best Scenarios for Agile:
1.	Software development with evolving requirements – E.g., a startup developing an innovative mobile app.
2.	Customer-driven projects – E.g., an e-commerce website where user feedback is critical.
3.	Fast-changing industries – E.g., AI, fintech, or gaming where rapid innovation is necessary.
4.	Cross-functional teamwork and frequent iteration – E.g., developing a SaaS (Software as a Service) product where continuous updates are needed.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Different Types of Software Testing and Their Importance in Quality Assurance
Testing is a crucial part of software quality assurance (QA) to ensure that applications function correctly, meet requirements, and provide a good user experience. Below are the four key types of testing:

1. Unit Testing
Definition:
•	Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
•	Typically written and executed by developers using frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Jest (JavaScript).
Importance:
* Identifies bugs early before they propagate to other parts of the system.
* Ensures each function or method works correctly on its own.
* Helps with refactoring by ensuring changes don’t break existing functionality.
Example:
Testing a function that calculates a user’s total cart value in an e-commerce application.

2. Integration Testing
Definition:
•	Focuses on verifying the interaction between different modules, services, or components of an application.
•	Ensures that data flows correctly between modules, APIs, databases, and external services.
Importance:
* Detects issues related to module communication and data inconsistencies.
* Ensures third-party integrations (APIs, databases, payment gateways) work as expected.
* Helps prevent compatibility issues between different parts of the application.
Example:
Testing how the user authentication module interacts with the database and the front-end login form.

3. System Testing
Definition:
•	Tests the entire software system as a whole to verify that it meets functional and non-functional requirements.
•	Conducted in an environment similar to production.
Importance:
* Ensures the application behaves as expected in a real-world scenario.
* Validates both functional (e.g., login, search) and non-functional (e.g., performance, security) aspects.
* Helps identify system-wide defects before deployment.
Example:
Testing an entire banking application to ensure users can log in, transfer money, check balances, and receive notifications.

4. Acceptance Testing
Definition:
•	Determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for release.
•	Often performed by end users, business analysts, or quality assurance teams.
•	Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Beta Testing.
Importance:
* Ensures the software aligns with customer expectations and requirements.
* Reduces the risk of releasing a product that doesn’t meet business needs.
* Validates real-world scenarios before full deployment.
Example:
A retail company tests a new Point of Sale (POS) system in a store environment to confirm usability and reliability before rollout.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively interact with AI models, such as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It involves structuring queries or instructions in a way that guides the AI to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interactions
1.	Enhances Response Quality
o	Well-crafted prompts improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.
o	Example: Instead of asking, "Tell me about history?", a better prompt would be: "Provide a summary of World War II, including its causes, major events, and impact."

2.	Improves AI Efficiency
o	Reduces the need for trial-and-error by clearly specifying requirements.
o	Helps AI generate precise responses faster.

3.	Enables Customization and Control
o	By tweaking prompts, users can control tone, format, or depth of responses.
o	Example: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms for a beginner." vs. "Provide a technical overview of quantum computing for researchers."

4.	Facilitates Complex Task Execution
o	Used in AI-powered automation, coding assistance, content generation, and data analysis.
o	Example: "Generate Python code to extract text from a PDF using the PyPDF2 library."

5.	Optimizes AI Applications Across Industries
o	In education: Tailoring AI responses for tutoring or content creation.
o	In business: Enhancing AI-driven customer support or report generation.
o	In research: Refining AI queries for data analysis and summarization.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Make a painting of a man"

Improved Prompt:
"Make a portrait painting of a man in his early 30s, with a mustache, wearing a black suit and red tie on a white T-shirt, a black hat on with two mango trees in the background, and a blue sky with bright sun above"

Why is the Improved Prompt More Effective?
* Clearer Scope – Specifies that the response should focus on a man in his late 30s.
* More Specific – Requests what the features should look like including what he should be wearing and their colour, and what should be in the background of the painting rather than a broad, unfocused instruction.
* Concise and Direct – Removes ambiguity, ensuring the AI generates a relevant and informative response.
